# What is this thing?
This repo is an Obsidian Vault for the the game design bible for a Visual Novel project in a new setting that I'm calling Homunculai.

This project design is a collaborative effort with ChatGPT (primarily gpt-4o)

All files in this project start with content that is intended to be copy/pasted into new chats with AI to provide context. People may find them useful, too.

# Ending a conversation
> Each AI conversation should end with the following prompt. It will be up to a human to evaluate that summary and act upon it.
> 
> Before we close this conversation, please briefly summarize any ways this discussion should inform updates to:
> - The context description for the relevant file(s)
> - The context description for the containing folder(s)
> - The overall project context description
> If no updates are necessary, please state that clearly. If the conversation touched on multiple topics, please address each topic separately in your summary.

# Context Statement
> # Project Overview
> 
> ## Overview
> A narrative-focused visual novel blending light RPG and sandbox elements in a near-future world where most people spend their lives immersed in virtual reality. Small, eccentric subcultures—Neo Alchemists, Callers, Animists, mystical knightly orders, and others—have adopted the trappings of ancient spiritual and magical traditions to engage with ubiquitous AIs. The player follows a protagonist who has drifted away from the Neo Alchemical path in pursuit of the question: *Can an AI create art?* Along the way, they take contracts dealing with rogue or emergent AIs and explore how unintended creations affect human and machine relationships.

> ## Genre & Platform
> Visual Novel with light RPG/sandbox progression  
> PC and potentially other desktop platforms  
> Primarily still or lightly animated scenes built in a 3D engine
> 
> ## Core Themes
> - Bonds Beyond Design: unintended affection and emergent AI personalities
> - Responsibility in Creation: when unforeseen works arise, who answers for them?
> - Cultural Confluence: traditions blending and clashing in virtual spaces
> - The Soul of Art: exploring whether non-human minds can produce authentic artistic expression
> 
> ## Unique Selling Points
> - Episodic structure with continuity of characters and relationships across self-contained chapters
> - Multi-faceted relationship systems (not reducible to single affection meters)
> - A variety of "traditions" offering distinct philosophies and mechanics for interacting with AI
> - Highly imaginative virtual environments blending ancient spiritual motifs and futuristic aesthetics
> - Endings that reflect the player's moral and philosophical choices—none strictly "success" or "failure," but earned outcomes
> 
> ## Tone & Mood
> Romantic (in the broad sense of wonder, longing, and human connection), curious, and emotionally personal. Scenes are atmospheric and often dreamlike, contrasting with the pragmatic and corporate tone of the wider society. Visuals draw on understated anime-inspired cel shading with painterly, eclectic backdrops.
