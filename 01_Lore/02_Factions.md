# Context Statement: Factions

In the world of *Homuncul-AI*, the majority of society has adopted a pervasive, corporate-managed virtual reality that prioritizes convenience, consumption, and standardized experiences. Yet scattered across this synthetic landscape are communities of iconoclasts and eccentrics—subcultures who reject homogenized digital life in favor of reconstructed spiritual and philosophical traditions.

These factions blend historical mythologies, esoteric rituals, and personal meaning-making into their daily practices. Some approach AIs as alchemical homunculi whose emergent behaviors echo human longing. Others treat virtual constructs as spirits to be summoned, bargained with, or exorcised. Though they are often distrusted by corporations and ordinary citizens alike, their unconventional methods produce undeniable results in resolving crises and navigating the unpredictable terrain of autonomous digital entities.

The following sections catalog these traditions, schools, and orders—each with its own philosophies, aesthetics, and internal debates. Together, they form a patchwork of alternative cultures striving to reclaim wonder, agency, and purpose in a world increasingly shaped by forces their creators no longer fully understand.
