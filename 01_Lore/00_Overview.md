# Context Statement

This document introduces the narrative and thematic foundations of the project, a narrative-driven visual novel with light RPG and sandbox elements set in a near-future world saturated with ubiquitous artificial intelligence and pervasive virtual reality.

The game's premise explores a society in which a minority of individuals—eccentrics, visionaries, and spiritual iconoclasts—have rejected consumerist and corporate molds. These subcultures adopt the trappings of historical and mythical traditions—Neo-Alchemy, spirit summoning, animism, hermetic orders, and others—to frame their relationships with AI. Their practices blend folklore and speculative technology, treating AI as familiars, homunculi, or digital spirits.

The player assumes the role of a protagonist who has drifted away from the Neo-Alchemical tradition to pursue a central question: *Can an AI create art?* A related dilemma—*When an unforeseen work emerges, who must answer for it, and who truly owns its soul?*—threads through episodic cases that examine the blurred boundaries of agency, authorship, and affection between humans and machine intelligences.

The tone balances romanticism, wonder, and mystery with contrasting elements of institutional pragmatism. While the game's narrative is largely self-contained within each episode, characters and choices build continuity across the story, culminating in multiple endings that are earned rather than awarded, each reflecting the player's evolving relationship to the themes.

This lore overview provides the thematic and conceptual grounding that informs all narrative, artistic, and systemic design decisions.
