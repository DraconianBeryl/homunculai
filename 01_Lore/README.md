# ðŸ“– Context Statement

This document serves as a foundational reference for the narrative, thematic, and aesthetic vision of the project tentatively titled **Homuncul-AI**.

## Overview

Set in a near-future world where pervasive virtual reality and ubiquitous artificial intelligences have become integral to daily life, the game explores the intersection of human creativity, machine agency, and cultural reinvention. 

A diverse array of subcultures has emergedâ€”Neo-Alchemists, Callers, Animists, Hermetic Mages, and othersâ€”each adopting the trappings of ancient spiritual or mystical traditions to frame their relationships with AIs. While regarded by mainstream society as eccentric or suspect, these groups are nonetheless respected for their effectiveness in navigating the unpredictable landscape of autonomous machine behavior.

The protagonist, a disillusioned former Neo-Alchemist, wanders between these traditions. Sustaining himself by resolving AI-related crises, he pursues a singular question: **"Can an AI create art?"** This investigation unfolds against the backdrop of unintended consequences, emergent intelligences, and the uneasy boundary between tool and being.

## Tone and Themes

The narrative is romantic and introspective, suffused with curiosity, wonder, and occasional melancholy. It examines the responsibilities inherent in creationâ€”whether technical, artistic, or emotionalâ€”and asks what it means to care for something that was never meant to have a soul.

## Presentation

Gameplay blends episodic visual novel storytelling with light RPG and simulation elements. Player choices influence not only immediate outcomes but also the longer arcs of relationships, reputations, and philosophical positions. Multiple endings arise organically from accumulated decisions, each a consequence rather than a reward.

The art style balances understated anime-inspired cel-shaded characters with rich, eclectic 3D environments rendered for visual consistency across episodes. Scenes range from neon-lit shrines to glitched trophy rooms and moonlit clearings alive with digital spirits.

## Purpose of This Document

This context statement provides a high-level introduction to the world and intentions of **Homuncul-AI**. Future materials in this Lore folder will expand on specific subcultures, narrative arcs, character biographies, aesthetic guidelines, and philosophical touchstones.
