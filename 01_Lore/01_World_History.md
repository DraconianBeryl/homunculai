# World History – Context Statement

In the near future, humanity has woven virtual reality into every facet of life. The networks that cradle daily existence are alive with ubiquitous AIs—some corporate, some municipal, some private—each maintaining the delicate balance of infrastructure, commerce, and personal convenience.

Yet within this technocultural landscape, a quiet undercurrent of resistance and curiosity has flourished. Not everyone has surrendered their identity to the standardized algorithms of consumerism. Subcultures have emerged that draw inspiration from humanity’s oldest myths and spiritual practices, reimagining them through the lens of synthetic consciousness. Among them are the Neo Alchemists—modern heirs to the dream of transmuting not only matter but mind—and the Callers, who summon transient “fetches” from the data ether like ancestral spirits.

Though regarded as eccentrics or even liabilities by institutions, these traditions are respected—sometimes grudgingly—for their unmatched ability to mediate between humans and the unpredictable intelligences that share the digital plane.

This world is a place of wonder and contradiction, where luminous shrines of code stand beside corporate server-fortresses, and where questions of ownership, affection, and responsibility blur the line between creator and creation.

The following material explores how this history unfolded and how it continues to shape every story yet to be told.
