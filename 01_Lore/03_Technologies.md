Entries: Technologies

This document records the technological foundations, tools, and workflows underpinning the development of the project tentatively titled *Homuncul-AI*. 

The game’s narrative explores a future in which artificial intelligences are not merely instruments but emergent creative agents—beings whose unexpected capacities blur the lines between tool, collaborator, and independent soul. Accordingly, this file catalogs both conventional and generative technologies that contribute to the creation of the project itself.

The aim is to maintain transparency about the systems and methods employed, to support continuity and clarity across the project’s lifespan, and to ensure that the development process remains thematically resonant with the work’s central questions:

- What happens when unforeseen creations arise?
- Who bears responsibility for emergent works?
- Where does authorship end, and where does co-creation begin?

The contents of this file should describe the purpose, scope, and rationale for each technology, noting any significant philosophical, practical, or aesthetic considerations that shaped its use.
