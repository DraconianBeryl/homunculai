# Context Statement
> # ðŸ“˜ Meta: Vision, Foundations, and Context
> 
> This section of the game design bible focuses on the project at a meta levelâ€”capturing *why* it exists, *what* it aims to explore, and *how* it situates itself in a broader cultural and creative landscape.
> 
> Documents within this folder serve as guiding references to keep the team aligned around shared purpose, language, and inspiration. They are not specifications of mechanics or assets, but rather touchstones for creative intent.
> 
> **Subdocuments in this section include:**
> 
> - **Goals**  
>   Articulates the core objectives of the project, both experiential and philosophical.
> 
> - **Lexicon**  
>   Defines important terms, traditions, and recurring concepts to ensure consistent usage across the project.
> 
> - **Inspirations**  
>   Chronicles the artistic, literary, and technological influences shaping the work, from historical authors to contemporary aesthetic trends.
> 
> This material is intended to help any contributorâ€”writer, artist, developerâ€”understand the deeper creative and cultural context of the game, so their work can reflect and extend the projectâ€™s vision.
