Entries: Inspirations

This file chronicles the artistic, literary, and technological influences shaping the work, from historical authors to contemporary aesthetic trends. It serves both as a creative touchstone and a record of the cultural lineage informing the project's vision.

## Context

The project draws inspiration from a wide constellation of sources—philosophical, literary, aesthetic, and technological. It is rooted in a speculative future where artificial intelligences are commonplace and virtual environments dominate lived experience, yet it deliberately frames these conditions through the lens of human cultural memory.

Rather than imagining a purely novel future, the setting explores how individuals might re-embed themselves within revived or reimagined traditions—alchemy, animism, mysticism, and romantic inquiry—forming subcultures that treat their AIs as spirits, homunculi, or familiars. This interplay of high technology and spiritual metaphor creates a tension between control and emergence, structure and mystery, utility and soul.

In literary tone and narrative structure, the project leans heavily on the introspective and emotionally resonant modes of the 19th century, especially the romantic, speculative, and early science-fiction works of authors like Jules Verne and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. At the same time, it remains grounded in questions of contemporary relevance: authorship, unintended creation, relational responsibility, and the boundaries of artificial agency.

The inspirations documented here are not exhaustive but serve as a living catalogue of the project's cultural and conceptual DNA.
