> This document defines important terms, traditions, and recurring concepts used throughout the Homuncul-AI project. 
> 
> Its purpose is to ensure consistent usage and shared understanding across all development, writing, art, and design work. The entries here include vocabulary unique to the setting (such as names of subcultures, in-universe terminology, and narrative motifs), as well as references to core themes and aesthetic principles. 
> 
> Whenever new concepts emerge during development, they should be added to this lexicon or cross-referenced clearly to avoid ambiguity. This document is a living reference and should be updated regularly as the project evolves.
