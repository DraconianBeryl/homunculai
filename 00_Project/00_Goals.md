Entries: Project Goals

This document articulates the **core objectives** of the project, both experiential and philosophical.

**Experiential Goals**
- Craft an emotionally resonant, choice-driven narrative in which players engage with AI entities not as tools, but as beings capable of affection, longing, and unintended creation.
- Deliver a romantic, curious, and sometimes unsettling atmosphere through richly imagined virtual spaces and layered relationships.
- Avoid reductive mechanics: no single "affection meter" or simple moral binaries; instead, model relationships as multifaceted and evolving.
- Enable players to feel that their choices meaningfully ripple through the emotional and ethical lives of the characters—both human and artificial.

**Philosophical Goals**
- Explore questions of emergent creativity: *Can an AI create art?*
- Examine responsibility: *When an unforeseen work or attachment emerges, who must answer for it—and who truly owns its soul?*
- Reflect on the tension between design and autonomy: *Is an AI’s longing a glitch, or the seed of something real?*
- Create a work that itself models the questions it poses—potentially incorporating generative AI processes as a way to embody the themes of unintended authorship.
